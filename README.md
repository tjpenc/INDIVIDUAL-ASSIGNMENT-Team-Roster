### Features
This app features a sign in and sign out button that functions through firebase authentication. Once logged in, a user will only see their created team members. A team memeber has an edit functionality that will update that member, and a delete button that will remove that team member from the database. A user can create new team members and give them a name, a role, and put a URL in for an image they want to display on the member card. There is also a search bar that will search a users members and display any members whos name or role matches the search query.
